# sms-gateway-ph.me
SMS gateway, used smsgateway.me as a server. 
Developed out of curiosity. 

#Instructions to make this thing work.

1. Go to https://smsgateway.me/
2. Sign-up to get an account and KEY/ID
3. Go to Documentaion and get the message API or call API
4. Embed it to your webpage.
5. Go to send.php, edit the ID to your ID, email address to your email address.
6. Download smsgateway app on playstore
7. Log-in, the app is used to check the server for failure transactions or simply check if your message is sent or not

**When using this, your phone must be connected to the internet and it must have load subscription or else it wont send your message. What it does is, the server uses your sim card's load subscription to be able to send a message. The recipient will then be receiving the message comming from your number. 

This has alot more to improve. Enjoy!
